# Personal expenses tracking system

The following project is a system that tracks and analyzes credit card expenses on a monthly basis.

The monthly credit card expenses are downloaded from the "Isracard" website as Excel files and stored in a dedicated folder.

Using Python's "Pandas" library, each file is cleaned from irrelevant data, and data types are modified so that the data can now be analyzed in an efficient way.

With the "sqlalchemy" library, a connection is established with a local SQL DBMS, and the data is imported as tables to the database that was created on the server.

Using the "DBeaver" database tool, SQL queries explore the data for financial insights and expense review.

The project is built in a way that it can be updated and maintained  on monthly basis with high efficiency.

Python scripts and SQL queries are available in the files attached.
